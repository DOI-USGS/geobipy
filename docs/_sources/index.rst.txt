Welcome to GeoBIPy: Geophysical Bayesian Inference in Python
############################################################

This package uses a Bayesian formulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods to
derive posterior distributions of subsurface and measured data properties.
The current implementation is applied to time and frequency domain electromagnetic data.
Application outside of these data types is in development.

Currently there are two types of data that we have implemented; frequency domain electromagnetic data,
and time domain electromagnetic data.
The package comes with a frequency domain forward modeller, but it does not come with a time domain forward modeller.
See the section :ref:`Installing_time_domain_forward_modeller` for more information.
