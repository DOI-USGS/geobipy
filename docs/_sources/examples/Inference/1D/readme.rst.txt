1D Inference
------------

There are a couple of ways to run an inference using geobipy, the first is via command line using

.. code-block:: bash

    geobipy skytem_options.py <output folder>

The other is with a python script similar to the examples in this folder.
In both cases, you will need to write an options file (also shown in these examples)
