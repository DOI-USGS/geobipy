# ------------------
# The data priors are impose0d on three different aspects of the data.

# If the data file contains columns of the estimated standard deviations, they are used as the initial values
# when starting an McMC inversion. If the file does not contain these estimates, then the initial
# standard deviations are calculated using sqrt((relative * data)^2 + (additive)^2).

# If there are multiple systems (e.g. Skytem, usually low and high moment, and hence 2 systems)
# the relative and additive values below should have enough values to match the number of systems.
# e.g. for Skytem, the initial_relative_error might = [0.03, 0.03],

# If the file contains no standard deviations, this will be used
